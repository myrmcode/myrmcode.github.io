<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
Hi! 👋 I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [University of Montreal, LIGUM](http://www.ligum.umontreal.ca/) under the supervision of [Prof. Mikhail Bessmeltsev](http://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~bmpix/). My current work is about sketch geometry processing using mathematical modeling.

I completed my Ph.D. in mathematical physics under the supervision of [Prof. Jiří Patera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji%C5%99%C3%AD_Patera_(mathematician)) in 2021. My [thesis](https://papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca/xmlui/handle/1866/25600) presents a study of applications of finite reflection groups to the problems related to two-dimensional lattices and three-dimensional polytopes.
