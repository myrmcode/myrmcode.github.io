  abstract = {A vector sketch is a popular and natural geometry representation depicting a 2D shape. When viewed from afar, the disconnected vector strokes of a sketch and the empty space around them visually merge into positive space and negative space, respectively. Positive and negative spaces are the key elements in the composition of a sketch and define what we perceive as the shape. Nevertheless, the notion of positive or negative space is mathematically ambiguous: While the strokes unambiguously indicate the interior or boundary of a 2D shape, the empty space may or may not belong to the shape's exterior. <br> For standard discrete geometry representations, such as meshes or point clouds, some of the most robust pipelines rely on discretizations of differential operators, such as Laplace-Beltrami. Such discretizations are not available for vector sketches; defining them may enable numerous applications of classical methods on vector sketches. However, to do so, one needs to define the positive space of a vector sketch, or the sketch shape. <br> Even though extracting this 2D sketch shape is mathematically ambiguous, we propose a robust algorithm, Alpha Contours, constructing its conservative estimate: a 2D shape containing all the input strokes, which lie in its interior or on its boundary, and aligning tightly to a sketch. This allows us to define popular differential operators on vector sketches, such as Laplacian and Steklov operators. <br> We demonstrate that our construction enables robust tools for vector sketches, such as As-Rigid-As-Possible sketch deformation and functional maps between sketches, as well as solving partial differential equations on a vector sketch.},

  ABSTRACT = {Two types of bivariate discrete weight lattice Fourier&ndash;Weyl transforms are related by the central splitting decomposition. The two-variable symmetric and antisymmetric Weyl orbit functions of the crystallographic reflection group A₂ constitute the kernels of the considered transforms. The central splitting of any function carrying the data into a sum of components governed by the number of elements of the center of A₂ is employed to reduce the original weight lattice Fourier&ndash;Weyl transform into the corresponding weight lattice splitting transforms. The weight lattice elements intersecting with one-third of the fundamental region of the affine Weyl group determine the point set of the splitting transforms. The unitary matrix decompositions of the normalized weight lattice Fourier&ndash;Weyl transforms are presented. The interpolating behavior and the unitary transform matrices of the weight lattice splitting Fourier&ndash;Weyl transforms are exemplified.},

  ABSTRACT = {The invariants of finite-dimensional representations of simple Lie algebras, such as even-degree indices and anomaly numbers, are considered in the context of the non-crystallographic finite reflection groups H₂, H₃ and H₄. Using a representation-orbit replacement, the definitions and properties of the indices are formulated for individual orbits of the examined groups. The indices of orders two and four of the tensor product of k orbits are determined. Using the branching rules for the non-crystallographic Coxeter groups, the embedding index is defined similarly to the Dynkin index of a representation. Moreover, since the definition of the indices can be applied to any orbit of non-crystallographic type, the algorithm allowing to search for the orbits of smaller radii contained within any considered one is presented for the Coxeter groups H₂ and H₃. The geometrical structures of nested polytopes are exemplified.},

  abstract = {The study of the polyhedra described in this paper is relevant to the icosahedral symmetry in the assembly of various spherical molecules, biomolecules and viruses. A symmetry-breaking mechanism is applied to the family of polytopes ${\cal V}_{H_{3}}(\lambda)$ constructed for each type of dominant point $\lambda$. Here a polytope ${\cal V}_{H_{3}}(\lambda)$ is considered as a dual of a ${\cal D}_{H_{3}}(\lambda)$ polytope obtained from the action of the Coxeter group $H_3$ on a single point $\lambda\in{\bb R}^{3}$. The $H_3$ symmetry is reduced to the symmetry of its two-dimensional subgroups $H_2$, $A_1 \times A_1$ and $A_2$ that are used to examine the geometric structure of ${\cal V}_{H_{3}}(\lambda)$ polytopes. The latter is presented as a stack of parallel circular/polygonal orbits known as the `pancake' structure of a polytope. Inserting more orbits into an orbit decomposition results in the extension of the ${\cal V}_{H_{3}}(\lambda)$ structure into various nanotubes. Moreover, since a ${\cal V}_{H_{3}}(\lambda)$ polytope may contain the orbits obtained by the action of $H_3$ on the seed points $(a,0,0)$, $(0,b,0)$ and $(0,0,c)$ within its structure, the stellations of flat-faced ${\cal V}_{H_{3}}(\lambda)$-polytopes are constructed whenever the radii of such orbits are appropriately scaled. Finally, since the fullerene $C_{20}$ has the dodecahedral structure of ${\cal V}_{H_{3}}(a,0,0)$, the construction of the smallest fullerenes $C_{24}$, $C_{26}$, $C_{28}$, $C_{30}$ together with the nanotubes $C_{20+6N}$, $C_{20+10N}$ is presented.},

We introduce how to obtain a graphene sheet using group theoretical methods and how to construct a graphene layer using the method of dynamical generation of quasicrystals. Both approaches can be formulated in such a way that the points of an infinite graphene sheet are generated. The main objective is to describe how to generate graphene step by step from a single point of ℝ².},
